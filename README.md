Energy Management System for Electric Vehicles (EVs)

Description: 
-----------
Design and develop an Energy Management System for Electric
Vehicles (EVs) aimed at optimizing energy consumption and improving
vehicle efficiency. 
The system should monitor and evaluate various
parameters such as battery health, energy consumption patterns, regenerative
braking efficiency, and overall vehicle performance in real-time. The software
solution must include a user-friendly interface that provides drivers with key
insights into their energy usage through graphical performance evaluations,
including energy savings, range estimations, and power usage breakdowns.

Additionally, the system should offer suggestions for energy optimization,
such as ideal driving habits, routes, and charging cycles. The challenge is to
integrate real-time data analytics and intelligent algorithms to help EV users
make informed decisions, ensuring a balance between performance and
energy conservation.
This solution will support the sustainability goals of the
EV sector by enhancing both user experience and energy efficiency
